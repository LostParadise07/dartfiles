## Usage

To start the app, run the following command in your terminal:

python3 run.py

This will start the app and you can access it in your web browser
You will be having two folders in the root directory of the project:
- `auth_app`: contains your Flask app
- `instance`: contains your database
## Project Directory Structure
The directory structure for this project is as follows:
```bash 
auth_app/
├── auth/
│ ├── forms.py
│ ├── routes.py
│ └── templates/
│ ├── login.html
│ ├── register.html
│ ├── reset_password.html
│ ├── reset_request.html
│ └── base.html
│ └── utils.py
├── static/
│ ├── bootstrap/
│ ├── js/
│ ├── iitd-logo.png
│ ├── profile_picture/
│ ├── uploads/
│ └── style.css
├── user/
│ ├── forms.py
│ ├── models.py
│ ├── routes.py
│ └── templates/
│ ├── account.html
│ ├── admin.html
│ ├── error.html
│ ├── choosefile.html
│ ├── history.html
│ ├── navbar.html
│ ├── upload.html
│ └── verify_users.html
│ └── utils.py
├── run.py
├── utils1.py
└── data.db
```

The `auth` folder contains all files related to user authentication, while the `user` folder contains files related to user management with authentication. 

Both `auth/routes.py` and `user/routes.py` contain functions that are called in the main Flask application. `forms.py` files in both folders contain functions for creating forms for user input. The `models.py` file in the `user` folder contains the structure of the database.

Please note that the `templates` directory contains HTML templates for rendering pages in the web application, while the `static` directory contains static files such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

## Database Management

To manage the database for this project, you will need to have SQLite3 installed on your system. Once you have SQLite3 installed, you can open the database in sqlite3

From here, you can perform various SQL commands to modify the data stored in the database.

Please note that there will always be one user designated as the super admin, with an ID of 0. When you add the first user to the system, you will need to manually update their ID to 0 in order to designate them as the super admin.

If you are not familiar with SQLite3 or SQL commands in general, we recommend reviewing relevant documentation and resources to ensure proper management of your database.
